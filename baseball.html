    <h2>The Boys of Summer</h2>
    <p>
        The Toronto Blue Jays, Canadas lone baseball team and the winners of Canada's last championship before the Raptors won in 2019. The Jays are in a rebuilding years
        as most of the big hitters from playoffs past has moved on to a new team. However, the Blue Jays do have some young talent in Vladimir Guerrero jr and Bo Bichette.
        The future looks bright for the Jays and hopefully they can bring another championship to Canada in the near future.

    <h2>Americas Favourite Pastime</h2>
    <p>
        The MLB is North Americas oldest organization when regarding the big 4 (Basketball, Hockey, Baseball and Football). With this fact the audience tends to skew older with not alot of kids watching.
        Even with this fact the MLB is one of the most popular organizations due to a highly competitive postseason and highly marketable players. Some of Canadas best players include Joey Votto,
        Justin Morneau, Russel Martin and many more. The reason the playoffs is so fun to watch is because of the unpredictability. The 2019/2020 season saw the Washington Nationals win the World Series,
        even with them being a last place team earlier in the year. Baseball is truly one of the greatest sports there is.
