    <h2>The new GOAT in the NFL</h2>
    <p>
        This is a image about the greatest football player in our generation, he leads the new age quaterbacks with his explosive are and trick passes.
        He is already an MVP and is primed to repeat the same achievement year as well. He is currently the quarter back for the Kansas City Chiefs
        and is coached under the leadership of head coach Andy Reid. This offensive juggaurnaut of a team only weakness had to be there defence. Last year Mahomes Cheif's were a defensive
        error away from attending there fourth Superbowl. Hopefully this year Patrick "Mahomey" Mahomes will succeed and win his first Superbowl.

    <h2>"The Baddddd Mannnnnn" of the NFL</h2>
    <p>
        This is an image of the "Bad man" Aaron Rodgers one of the most gifted Qbs in NFL history, he is also known as the "King of Hail Mary's" because of all his late game heroics
        against teams like the Bears. He is a superbowl champion and a MVP, some regard him as one of the most talented QBs in the history of the NFL. Rodgers plays for the Green Bay
        Packers and is in the NFC and is an MVP candidate. His new head coach is Matt LaFleur a first year coach with innovative strategies that plays into Rodgers strengths.
        Last year with Rodgers the Packers did not make the playoffs as there road record was atrocious, but he did have a great season. This year with a much improved defence Rogers hopes
        to lead his team to another Vince Lombardi trophy.
